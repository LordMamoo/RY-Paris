                <p>"No more dry, lackluster burgers. These are juicy, and spices can be easily added or changed to suit anyone's taste. Base frequently with your favorite barbeque sauce. if you find the meat mixture too mushy, just add more bread crumbs until it forms patties that hold their shape."</p>

                    <li>Using your hands, break the meat into small pieces and combine evenly but loosely on a parchment or waxed paper-lined baking sheet. Spread the meat out and season it generously with salt and pepper. If desired, add the spice mix at this time.</li>
                    <li>Divide the meat into 4 portions (about 6 ounces each). Using your hands, form each portion into a ball-shape by gently tossing it from 1 hand to the other. (Don't over work or press too firmly on the meat.) Gently form each portion into a patty about 3 1/2 inches wide and 1-inch-thick.</li>
                    <li>Preheat a large cast iron skillet over medium-low heat for 5 minutes. Raise the heat to high and add the oil. Add the patties and cook. turning once, until well-browned, about 2 minutes each side.</li>
